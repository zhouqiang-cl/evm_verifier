# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

require nodejs

```shell
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
npx hardhat verify --network goerli {your contract address}
```
